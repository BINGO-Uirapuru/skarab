# SKARAB

**SKARAB** is an agile, networked, FPGA-centric cluster computing or instrument node. The Square Kilometre Array Reconfigurable Application Board (SKARAB) is the latest generation of CASPER FPGA hardware. It is the next generation/successor to the ROACH2 platform.

# BINGO

The *BINGO* Project aims at building a special purpose radio telescope to map redshifted neutral hydrogen emission between z = 0.13 and 0.45.

*BINGO* stands for **B**aryon Acoustic Oscillations from **I**ntegrated **N**eutral **G**as **O**bservations.

It is an international project with collaborators in Brazil, China, United Kingdom, France, South Africa, Germany, and United States. It is the only radio telescope that proposes mapping neutral gas as traced by the 21cm line on large angular scales at redshift z~0.3.

# Application

The BINGO project uses the skarab to process the data read by the antenna before sending it to the server for further processing and database saving.
